Responsive Landing Page with Interactive Navigation Bar

In this task, there is a responsive landing page with an interactive navigation bar. The navigation bar includes a hover effect where a block smoothly expands around the menu item when the cursor hovers over it. The bar also remains fixed at the top of the page, changing its background color when the page is scrolled. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
